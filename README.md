# garena
Arena allocator written in C23, written to compliment my similar [C89 arena allocator project](https://www.github.com/ccgargantua/arena-allocator). This project is meant to be a bit more modern and fancy, as well as a different approach to code style and safety.

## Usage
Consult comments above function declarations. You can define the `GARENA_DEBUG` macro. It will enable internal assertions.

Simply **build** the object file and link it in your own project. I recommend copying the source over to your project source.
