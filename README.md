# garena
Arena allocator written in C11, written to compliment to my similar [C89 arena allocator project](https://www.github.com/ccgargantua/arena-allocator). This project is meant to be a bit more modern and fancy, as well as a different approach to code style and safety.

**Disclaimer!** This project is bare bones and currently a work in progress. That being said, it has basic functionality. Feel free to use it in its current underdeveloped and under-tested state. Expect updated documentation in the future.
